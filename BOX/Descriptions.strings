"Household Cleaner" = "At each stage of your life, you’ve needed different kinds of clean. Your college dorm room had a base level of grime that our Dusterator canister took care of.

You trusted your newborn’s bottom to nothing but our Tik-Tyke-To Diapers.

"medication" = "You remember the first mountain you climbed. It wasn’t Everest, or anything. But still, when you stood at its summit and gazed at the valley below, you felt like you could do anything in the world. You’ve done a lot since then, and climbed all kinds of mountains. And lately, you’ve found it just a little harder to reach your summits. BOX is here to help.
