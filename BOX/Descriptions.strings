"Household Cleaner" = "At each stage of your life, you’ve needed different kinds of clean. Your college dorm room had a base level of grime that our Dusterator canister took care of.  Your first apartment had a stain on the stovetop that only our Germ-Be-Gone Wipes could handle. Your fine china was sparkling at your wedding rehearsal dinner, thanks to our Crystal Boost formula. You trusted your newborn’s bottom to nothing but our Tik-Tyke-To Diapers. Now, as the last night’s spaghetti sauce mingles with the grass stains from the morning’s soccer game on the front of your young one’s tee shirt, trust BOX as you keep your family sparklingly clean and on the move, so you can be ready for whatever life, or your young ones, throw your way.";

"ToyKid’s Product" = "Placeholder";

"Medication" = "You remember the first mountain you climbed. It wasn’t Everest, or anything. But still, when you stood at its summit and gazed at the valley below, you felt like you could do anything in the world. You’ve done a lot since then, and climbed all kinds of mountains. And lately, you’ve found it just a little harder to reach your summits. BOX is here to help.  The only FDA-approved treatment for general limb achiness, balding, and acute mitochondrial inflammation, BOX can bring you back to that summit, full of energy and ready to keep climbing.";
